heterarchy
==========

Cooperative multiple inheritance for CoffeeScript, รก-la Python.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/arximboldi/heterarchy.svg)]
(https://travis-ci.org/arximboldi/heterarchy)

Adds multiple inheritance support to CoffeeScript (and JavaScript).
It uses the C3 linearization algorithm as described in the [famous
Dylan paper](http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html).

Example
-------

The library handles multiple inheritance and chains calls to `super`
in a linear order, solving the diamond problem and allowing for
[cooperative methods](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=281127). For
example, the following class heterarchy:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/arximboldi/heterarchy/master/pic/diamond.svg"/>
</div>

Can be implemented with the following code.

```coffee
{multi} = require 'heterarchy'

class A
    method: -> "A"

class B extends A
    method: -> "B > #{super}"

class C extends A
    method: -> "C > #{super}"

class D extends multi B, C
    method: -> "D > #{super}"
```

Calling `method` on a `D` instance would return the string `D > C > B > A`
showing the class linearization.
